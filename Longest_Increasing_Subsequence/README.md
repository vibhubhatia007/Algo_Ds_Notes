# Longest Increasing Subsequence

The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence of a given sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order. For example, the length of LIS for `{10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80}` is `6` and LIS is `{10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80}`.

## Examples

```
Input  : arr[] = {3, 10, 2, 1, 20}
Output : Length of LIS = 3
The longest increasing subsequence is 3, 10, 20

Input  : arr[] = {3, 2}
Output : Length of LIS = 1
The longest increasing subsequences are {3} and {2}

Input : arr[] = {50, 3, 10, 7, 40, 80}
Output : Length of LIS = 4
The longest increasing subsequence is {3, 7, 40, 80}
```

## Recursive Approach

```
Let arr[0..n-1] be the input array and L(i) be the length of the LIS ending at index i such that arr[i] is the last element of the LIS.

Then, L(i) can be recursively written as:

L(i) = 1 + max( L(j) ) where 0 < j < i and arr[j] < arr[i]; or
L(i) = 1, if no such j exists.

To find the LIS for a given array, we need to return max(L(i)) where 0 < i < n.

Thus, we see the LIS problem satisfies the optimal substructure property as the main problem can be solved using solutions to subproblems.
```

## Pseudo Code

```
LIS(A[1..n]):
    Array L[1..n]
    (* L[i] = value of LIS ending(A[1..i]) *)
    for i = 1 to n do
        L[i] = 1
        for j = 1 to i âˆ’ 1 do
            if (A[j] < A[i]) do
                L[i] = max(L[i], 1 + L[j])
    return L

MAIN(A[1..n]):
    L = LIS(A[1..n])
        return the maximum value in L
```

## Overlapping Subproblems:

Considering the above implementation, following is recursion tree for an array of size 4. lis(n) gives us the length of LIS for arr[].

```
                 lis(4)
        /          |        \
      lis(3)     lis(2)   lis(1)
     /     \       |
   lis(2) lis(1) lis(1)
   /
lis(1)
```
